# dietary_project

A new Flutter project.

To function normally and maintain life, the human body needs energy. To get this energy from the
nutrients, primarily the lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates should be included in the diet. Other
nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, are crucial for a healthy body and should be included in a diet as
well. To get the most health advantages from these many nutrients, it's crucial to strike the correct balance
in diet.

A nutritious diet plan may help in many ways. It may aid in the prevention of several serious illnesses like
type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Additionally, it might lower the risk of getting some
malignancies. A nutritious diet may hasten a user's recovery in the event of illness. Eating a
nutritious diet is another key strategy for preventing obesity. A good diet can assist a user who is
overweight or obese in losing, gaining or maintaining weight as well.

Therefore, we developed a mobile and web based application called “Dietiary” to offer a broader approach
in giving a better life through nutritious and fit diet plans to the users in order to smooth out their fitness
journey and improve their experience.

Using this online diet consultation application, users can receive online diet plans based on the information
provided. In addition to that, users of this application can create their own customized meal plans and
check whether they are within the required calorie standards or not. Also, mobile users will get daily
reminders as notifications of their diet plan.
